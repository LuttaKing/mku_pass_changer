# MKU_PASSWORD_MANAGER

This is a minimal project using python that helps students from #Mount Kenya University
to change their portal password easily.It eliminates the hussle of having to 
manually login into the portal and looking for the "change password section"(which
is not easy to find).

This is just a hobby project,just input your details,set your password;;;.....the rest is done automatically 

NB;NEW UPDATE SENDS YOUR NEW PASSWORD TO YOUR EMAIL
